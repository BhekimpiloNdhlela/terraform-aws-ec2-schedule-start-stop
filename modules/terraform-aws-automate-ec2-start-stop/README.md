# Terraform Module: Automate EC2 Start/Stop with Notifications

This Terraform module automates the start and stop of specified EC2 instances on a defined schedule using AWS EventBridge and Lambda. Notifications are sent via Amazon SNS and optionally reported to Microsoft Teams.

## Features

- Automatically start and stop EC2 instances based on cron or rate expressions.
- Filter EC2 instances using tags to identify which instances should be started or stopped.
- Send email notifications via SNS in case of errors or successful executions.
- Optional reporting to Microsoft Teams via a webhook.
- Configurable for different environments (e.g., `dev`, `test`, `prod`).

---

## Architecture/Infrastructure
This solution leverages the following AWS services:

- **AWS SNS**  
  Simple Notification Service (SNS) is used to send emails to the specified email endpoints. SNS is responsible for reporting errors or notifying the success/failure of the start/stop process.

- **AWS EventBridge Rule (STOP)**  
  This rule is configured to trigger the Lambda function to stop EC2 instances that match the specified tags.

- **AWS EventBridge Rule (START)**  
  This rule is configured to trigger the Lambda function to start EC2 instances that match the specified tags.

- **AWS Lambda**  
  The Lambda function is used to start or stop EC2 instances when triggered by an EventBridge rule, based on the defined schedule.

- **AWS S3**  
  An S3 bucket is used to store an external module (`requests`), which is required for making POST requests to the Microsoft Teams Incoming Webhook endpoint.

- **AWS SSM Parameter Store**  
  The Microsoft Teams Incoming Webhook URL is securely stored in AWS Systems Manager (SSM) Parameter Store.

The following is the infrastructure diagram of the solution:

## Usage

```hcl
module "automate_ec2_start_stop" {
  source = "github.com/BhekimpiloNdhlela/terraform-aws-ec2-schedule-start-stop.git"

  environment                = "prod"
  naming_prefix              = "ec2-auto-start-stop"
  region                     = "eu-west-1"
  notification_emails        = ["bheki@cloudandthings.io"]
  stop_expression            = "rate(2 minutes)"
  start_expression           = "rate(1 day)"
  ms_teams_reporting_enabled = true
  ms_teams_webhook_url       = "https://cloudandthingsza.webhook.office.com/..."
  error_email_subject        = "Lambda Error Notification [EC2 Start/Stop]"
  error_email_header         = "Hi üëãüèæ,\nThe following error occurred while running the Lambda function:\n"
  error_email_footer         = "Please check the AWS CloudWatch logs for more details.\nBest regards,\nFooBar Team"
  success_email_subject      = "Lambda Success Notification [EC2 Start/Stop]"
  success_email_header       = "Hi üëãüèæ,\nThe Lambda function executed successfully, the following EC2 instance(s) were terminated:\n"
  success_email_footer       = "Please review the AWS CloudWatch logs for detailed execution information.\nBest regards,\nFooBar Team"
  schedule_auto_start_key    = "scheduled-auto-start"
  schedule_auto_start_value  = "true"
  schedule_auto_stop_key     = "scheduled-auto-stop"
  schedule_auto_stop_value   = "true"
}
```
